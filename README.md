# React Portfolio Website
This repository contains the code for a portfolio website built using React.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can check if they are installed by running the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If they are not installed, you can download them from the Node.js website.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.

Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running the command npm start. This will start the server and open the website in your default browser.

### Making Changes
You can make changes to the code and see the updates in real-time as you save your changes. To build the website for production, run the command npm run build. This will create a build directory containing the optimized version of the website.
